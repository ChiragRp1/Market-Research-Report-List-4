<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Li-Ion Battery Separators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Method</li><li>Dry Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Li-Ion Battery Separators Market is segmented into two types based on the method of manufacturing: Wet Method and Dry Method. Wet Method involves the use of a solvent to create a slurry, which is then coated onto a substrate and dried to form the separator. Dry Method, on the other hand, involves directly extruding or casting a polymer material to form the separator, without the need for a solvent. Both methods have their own advantages and are widely used in the Li-Ion Battery Separator Market.</p></p>
