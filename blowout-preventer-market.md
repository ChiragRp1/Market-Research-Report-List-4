<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blowout Preventer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Annular BOP</li><li>Ram BOP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Blowout preventers (BOPs) are critical safety devices used in oil and gas drilling operations to prevent uncontrolled release of oil and gas from wells. They can be divided into two main types: Annular BOPs and Ram BOPs. Annular BOPs use a flexible elastomeric seal to close off the wellbore, while Ram BOPs use hydraulic rams to seal off the wellbore by closing around the drill pipe. Both types play a crucial role in preventing blowouts and protecting workers and the environment during drilling operations.</p></p>
