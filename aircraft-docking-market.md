<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Docking Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-propelled</li><li>Towed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft docking systems can be classified into two main types: self-propelled and towed. Self-propelled systems are equipped with their own engines and can move independently to the location where an aircraft needs to be docked. On the other hand, towed systems require a separate vehicle to pull them to the desired location. Both types of docking systems serve the same purpose of facilitating safe and efficient maintenance and boarding operations for aircraft. The choice between self-propelled and towed systems depends on factors such as the size of the aircraft and the layout of the docking area.</p></p>
