<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The De-SOx Scrubber Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop</li><li>Closed Loop</li><li>Hybrid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>De-SOx scrubber systems are classified into three main types: Open loop, closed loop, and hybrid. Open loop systems use seawater to remove sulfur oxides from exhaust gases, releasing the treated water back into the ocean. Closed loop systems use a circulating solution to capture sulfur oxides, which is then treated on-board the ship. Hybrid systems combine elements of both open and closed loop systems to achieve optimal performance. Each system offers different benefits and drawbacks depending on the specific requirements of the ship and its operations.</p></p>
