<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemoglobin Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chromatography</li><li>Immunoassay</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hemoglobin testing is commonly done through two main methods: chromatography and immunoassay. In chromatography, the different components of hemoglobin are separated based on their size and affinity for the stationary phase, providing detailed information about the types and quantities of hemoglobin present. Immunoassay, on the other hand, uses antibodies to specifically detect and quantify different forms of hemoglobin. Both methods play a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring conditions such as anemia and certain blood disorders.</p></p>
