<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thoracic Aortic Stent System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Type</li><li>Branched Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Thoracic Aortic Stent System market is divided into two main types: Straight Type and Branched Type. Straight Type stents are used in cases where the aortic anatomy allows for a straight deployment of the device. On the other hand, Branched Type stents are designed for more complex cases where the anatomy requires side branches to be incorporated into the stent design to ensure proper blood flow. Both types of stents cater to different patient needs and anatomical considerations in the treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysms.</p></p>
