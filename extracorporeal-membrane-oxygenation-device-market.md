<p><h1>Global Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Device Market Size and Market Trends: Insights and Projections from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Device Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Device is a life-saving technology that provides temporary heart and lung support for patients with severe respiratory or cardiac failure. The ECMO device works by removing blood from the patient's body, oxygenating it, and then returning it to the body, allowing the heart and lungs to rest and heal.</p><p>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Device Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.70% during the forecast period. The market growth is driven by the increasing incidence of respiratory and cardiac failure, rising geriatric population, and advancements in ECMO technology. Additionally, the growing awareness about ECMO therapy and its effectiveness in saving lives is also contributing to the market growth.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Device Market is the development of portable and compact ECMO devices that are more user-friendly and can be used in a wider range of healthcare settings. This trend is expected to further drive market growth in the coming years as it makes ECMO therapy more accessible and convenient for both healthcare providers and patients.</p></p>
