<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piston Pressure Boosters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage</li><li>Double Stage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Piston pressure boosters are commonly found in two main types: single stage and double stage. Single stage boosters operate on the principle of compression and boost the pressure of gases or liquids in a single step. On the other hand, double stage boosters perform the same function but in two stages, allowing for a higher level of pressure boost. Single stage boosters are simpler and more cost-effective, while double stage boosters offer higher efficiency and greater pressure capabilities.</p></p>
