<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vane Thermo Anemometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant Current Anemometer</li><li>Constant Pressure Anemometer</li><li>Thermostatic Anemometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vane thermo anemometers are commonly classified into three market types: constant current anemometers, constant pressure anemometers, and thermostatic anemometers. Constant current anemometers measure wind speed by maintaining a constant current through the sensor. Constant pressure anemometers measure wind speed by keeping the pressure across the sensor constant. Thermostatic anemometers measure wind speed by using a heated element to determine air flow. Each type of vane thermo anemometer has its own unique method of measuring wind speed accurately and effectively.</p></p>
