<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Fibre Noise Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glass fibre noise barriers are a type of soundproofing solution used to minimize noise pollution. Ground-mounted noise barriers are installed directly onto the ground, usually along highways or railway tracks, to absorb and reflect noise from passing vehicles or trains. Structure-mounted noise barriers are attached to existing structures, such as buildings or bridges, to reduce noise levels in urban areas. Both types of noise barriers help in creating quieter environments by blocking and reducing noise transmission from sources to surrounding areas.</p></p>
