<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Type Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous</li><li>Non-Porous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Membrane Type Dryer market is divided into two main types: Porous and Non-Porous. Porous membrane dryers use hollow fibers or membranes that allow moisture to pass through while trapping contaminants, making them suitable for removing water vapor from gas streams. Non-Porous membrane dryers, on the other hand, have a layer of selective permeable material that only allows water to pass through, making them more efficient in removing water from compressed air. Both types cater to different applications and industries based on their specific moisture removal capabilities.</p></p>
