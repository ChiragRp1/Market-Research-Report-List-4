<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground Referenced Generators</li><li>Isolated Generators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical generators are devices used in surgical procedures to deliver electrical energy to surgical instruments. Ground referenced generators are connected to a grounding electrode, providing a safe pathway for electrical current to flow. Isolated generators, on the other hand, do not require a grounding electrode as they isolate the electrical current from the patient's body. Both types of generators are used in various surgical procedures to ensure safe and effective delivery of electrical energy to the surgical instruments.</p></p>
