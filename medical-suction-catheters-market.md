<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Suction Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Suction Catheter</li><li>Closed Suction Catheter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical suction catheters are essential devices used in healthcare settings to remove fluid or debris from the respiratory tract. There are two main types of suction catheters: open suction catheters and closed suction catheters. </p><p>Open suction catheters are single-use devices that are inserted directly into the patient's airway to remove secretions. Closed suction catheters, on the other hand, feature a closed system that allows for a continuous suctioning process without the need to disconnect the catheter from the ventilator or breathing circuit. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining airway patency and promoting optimal respiratory function in patients.</p></p>
