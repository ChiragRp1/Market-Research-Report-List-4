<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SiC CMP Slurry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bulk Removal Slurry</li><li>Fine Polish Slurry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bulk Removal Slurries are used in the initial stages of the Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) process to remove excess material quickly and efficiently. These slurries have larger abrasive particles and higher viscosity to facilitate the rapid removal of material. On the other hand, Fine Polish Slurries are used in the final stages of CMP to achieve a smooth and polished surface finish. These slurries contain smaller abrasive particles and lower viscosity to provide a fine polishing effect and achieve the desired surface quality.</p></p>
