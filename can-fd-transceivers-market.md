<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CAN FD Transceivers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isolated</li><li>Non-isolated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CAN FD transceivers are split into two main market types: isolated and non-isolated. Isolated transceivers provide electrical isolation between the CAN controller and the physical bus, protecting the controller from voltage spikes and noise. This feature is essential for applications where high reliability and robustness are required. On the other hand, non-isolated transceivers do not provide this level of protection but are more cost-effective for applications where isolation is not necessary. Overall, the choice between isolated and non-isolated transceivers depends on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
