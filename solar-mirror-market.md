<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Mirror Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Trough Systems</li><li>Central Receiver Systems</li><li>Dish/Engine Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar mirrors are a key component in three main types of solar thermal power systems: trough systems, central receiver systems, and dish/engine systems. Trough systems use long, curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver tube running along the focal line of the mirrors. Central receiver systems use a field of mirrors to reflect sunlight onto a receiver tower located in the center. Dish/engine systems use a large, dish-shaped mirror to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver located at the focal point of the dish.</p></p>
