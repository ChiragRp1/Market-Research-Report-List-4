<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tunnel Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heavily Doped N-Type</li><li>Heavily Doped P-Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tunnel diodes are classified into two main types based on their doping levels: heavily doped N-type and heavily doped P-type. Heavily doped N-type tunnel diodes have a high density of electrons, making them efficient for applications requiring high-speed switching and high-frequency oscillations. On the other hand, heavily doped P-type tunnel diodes have a high density of holes, suitable for low-power applications and amplification. Each type has unique characteristics and is used in specific electronic applications based on its doping levels and properties.</p></p>
